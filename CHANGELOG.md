# CG.Linq.EFCore
---

## 2021.2

* I switched to the .NET 5.0 framework

## 2021.1

* I created a base class repository with no model refs

* I bumped the major version for the new year.

* I changed the build target from .net standard 2.0 to .net core 3.1

* I added extensions to deal with efcore related startup tasks, such as migrations and seeding.

* I added a factory for creating data-context instances.

* I modified the repository base to use the new data-context factory.

* I removed the CRUD repostitory base.

## 2020.5

* I copied the code from the old CG.Linq.EntityFramework.

* I switched from EntityContext back to a more traditional repository approach.

* Bug fixes
